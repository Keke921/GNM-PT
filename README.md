# GNM-PT
Temporary demo for GNM-PT.

The GNM is in [gnm.py](https://github.com/Keke921/RSAM-PT/blob/main/gnm.py). 


More quantitative metrics about the loss landscape and more visualization results are shown in [Author Response_figures_ID1397.pdf](https://github.com/Keke921/GNM-PT/blob/main/Author%20Response_figures_ID1397.pdf).
